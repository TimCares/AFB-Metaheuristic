= Introduction

In 2018, @afb introduced the Artificial Feeding Birds algorithm as a simple metaheuristic optimization scheme that can be easily adapted to new problems.
In this paper, we explore possible algorithmic improvements when applying the AFB to the traveling salesman problem.

In @tsp we define the Traveling Salesman Problem and in @algorithm_foundation we describe the basic Artificial Feeding Birds algorithm as defined in @afb.
In @Methodology we describe the methodology used to evaluate our adjustments of the algorithm and in @Improvements we iteratively improve the algorithm, describing the changes step by step and measuring their impact.
In @sop we apply the AFB algorithm to the Sequential Ordering Problem.
In @Analysis we analyze and interpret our results.
