// TODO

In @tsp we define the Traveling Salesman problem and in @algorithm_foundation we describe the basic Artificial Feeding Birds algorithm as defined in @afb.
In @Methodology we describe the methodology used to evaluate our adjustments of the algorithm and in @Improvements we iteratively improve the algorithm, describing the changes step by step and measuring their impact.
In @sop we apply the AFB algorithm to the Sequential Ordering Problem.
In @Analysis we analyze and interpret our results.
