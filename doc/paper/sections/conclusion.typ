= Conclusion

This paper focused on various improvements to the original AFB metaheuristic algorithm @afb.
Our changes signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce
the error rate of resulting TSP tours with respect to the optimum.

Thanks to an early stopping mechanism,
we were able to significantly reduce the computation time 
for larger TSP configurations, while retaining the previously achieved performance.

We were careful to keep the algorithms simplicity so that it remains easy to apply to 
new problems, and focused on conveying the importance of a balanced exploration
and exploitation by considering both aspects when reasoning with our improvements.

We believe that our experiments show the AFB algorithm to be a 
competitive metaheuristic while being useful for educational 
purposes due to its ease of implementation and intuitive deduction from nature.
