= Conclusion

This paper focused on various improvements to the original AFB metaheuristic @afb.
Our changes significantly reduced the error rate of resulting TSP tours and improved the convergence speed of the algorithm.
We were careful to keep the algorithms simplicity so it remains easy to apply to new problems.
We believe that our experiments show the AFB algorithm to be a competitive metaheuristic which can also be useful for educational purposes due to the ease of implementation.
